The 8 Week SQL Challenge is proudly brought to you by the [Data With Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com) virtual data apprenticeship program!

## About Me

I like to describe myself as a recovering data scientist, amateur cook, house plant caretaker and aspiring stand-up data comedian who simply loves helping others on their data journey.

My vision is to create my own little corner of the world/internet where everyone can feel supported and motivated to continue growing on their learning journey. I really put my heart and soul into this - so it really means a lot to me everytime I hear about the success and achievements of those who I've helped!

## Contact Me

Please feel free to share your success stories with me and the rest of the community - I am always here to celebrate your wins, and to help support you when you need it, you can count on me!

Thank you so much for being a part of this all and I really wish you the best of luck on your data journey!
