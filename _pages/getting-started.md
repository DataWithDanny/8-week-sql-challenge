The 8 Week SQL Challenge is proudly brought to you by the [Data With Danny](https://bit.ly/datawithdanny-8wsc) virtual data apprenticeship program to celebrate the launch of the [Serious SQL](https://bit.ly/3gWUT2G) course!

> What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge?

My idea was to create a community which supports all data professionals who were specifically starting on their SQL learning journey.

I also wanted to help everyone start crafting their own personal branding, online presence and a personal portfolio of data projects - and so the 8 Week SQL Challenge was born!

For the next 8 weeks - I challenge you to:

* Dedicate yourself to learning SQL
* Share regular updates on social media about what you are learning
* Actively participate in the 8 Week SQL Challenge Slack community, ask questions and join in the discussion to help others
* Get started on your own GitHub Pages personal website and project portfolio

> How can I get started with the challenge?

1. [Register](https://signup.8weeksqlchallenge.com) for the 8 Week SQL Challenge
2. Introduce yourself on the official Slack channel
3. Share an update on LinkedIn using the dedicated #8WeekSQLChallenge hashtag
4. Start your SQL learning journey!

Here's an example post you could share on LinkedIn - please feel free to improvise and personalise your post as much as you like!

> What is Serious SQL?

Serious SQL is an online course that I've created - it is the very first part of the Data With Danny virtual apprenticeship program.

</div>

Here are a few reasons why I think Serious SQL is perfect for anyone starting their data and SQL learning journey - I've created this course to help beginners and experienced practitioners alike!

* Health analytics
* Marketing analytics
* People analytics
* Financial markets
* Fast moving consumer goods
* Digital marketing
<br>

### Topics Covered

Cover many core SQL skills and techniques required for data analysis from beginner to advanced levels including:
* Where filters and ordering data
* Group by aggregates
* Identifying and dealing with duplicate data
* Common table expressions and subqueries
* Summary statistics
* Exploratory data analysis
* Complex table joins
* Entity relationship diagrams
* SQL reverse engineering
* Data problem solving techniques
* All the window functions
* Case When Statements
* Recursive CTEs
* Cumulative aggregates
* Simple, weighted and exponential moving metrics
* Historical vs Snapshot data analysis techniques
* Temporary tables, database views and materialized views
* Interpret SQL optimizer execution plans
* String transformations including Regular Expressions
* Date and Timestamp manipulation including timezones
* Different types of table indexes
* Impact of indexes on simple table operations
* Loading raw data
* Table schemas and data types

### Additional Bonus Content

* Learn how to setup your own GitHub Pages project portfolio page with a guided step-by-step guide

* Full access to complete solutions for all case studies included in the 8 Week SQL Challenge with full explanations

### Course Setup

All database and SQL interface infrastructure are Docker based and I'll help you get setup for Docker Desktop on Windows, Mac and Linux systems - Docker is simply a must-have skill if you want to move into data science and machine learning!

Installation and setup of all required data and systems is super fast and will run on all machine types that support Docker Desktop including Windows, Ubuntu and all Macs including the latest generation of Apple M1 Macs.

### Dedicated Support

We also have dedicated Q&A threads for each separate course tutorial as well as a dedicated SQL Support Forum where all students enrolled in the course can share their SQL problems for direct assistance - even if its for data or problems that are not included in the course.

[Serious SQL](https://bit.ly/3gWUT2G) is currently on sale for $29 and $19 for students from the standard price of $39 and $29, but only for a limited time so don't miss out!

> Will you be providing case study coding solutions?

If you'd like to see the complete code solutions and detailed explanations for all case studies and a whole lot more, please consider joining me for the Serious SQL course - you'll get access to all course materials, case study solutions and I'm on hand to answer all of your additional SQL questions directly!

Serious SQL students get access to complete solutions for each case study, they will be made available directly inside the Serious SQL course player after the case studies are published here so everyone has a chance to try and solve the problems before solutions are provided.

Complex sections identified by students will also have specific video explanations to cover key problem areas - join me to get customised support and in-depth explanations for the parts which you find most challenging.

> I'm nervous about sharing stuff on LinkedIn - what should I do?

I totally understand this as I was in exactly the same position - scared out of my wits and never bringing myself to post anything!

The secret is to start posting regularly and aim to help others with your posts. That was the one single thing that really helped me grow on LinkedIn!

Remember the following tips for LinkedIn posts to maximise your reach:

* Avoid sharing direct links in posts as reach is depressed for external and post shares - add the URLs after by editing your original post

* Be sure to keep your first 2-3 lines catchy and snappy - you only have a few seconds to capture someone's attention in this digital world

* Sometimes it helps to post an eye-catching picture - we humans process visual information much more efficiently than reading

* The initial `like:view` ratio is the main determinant for your post reach, reshares also help boost overall view counts

* Limit your amount of hashtags per post to 3-4 and aim for tags with lots of followers or specific community hashtags (like #8WeekSQLChallenge or #DataWithDanny or #66DaysOfData) - you can check the counts by clicking on the hashtag on LinkedIn (#Data #Analytics #DataScience #BigData are my go to tags for reach!)

* Resharing other people's posts is a good way to help promote their content but will usually generate low view counts for your post, this is normal

* Join in the conversation and regularly comment on popular influencers' posts

You might laugh at that last point - but trust me! This really works because this is pretty much how I became friends with many data superstars like Eric Weber, Ben Taylor and Kate Strachnyi :)
